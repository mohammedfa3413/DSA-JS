note : our code should run in 1sec if not the code is not optimal 
note : the code should run <=10^8


session3-Agenda 
	Strings
	Binary search




			1.Strings  (" ")

Space Complexity : o(n);
note : this also follows the indexing method
note : 2 types of String 1.Mutable and 2. Immutable 
	Mutable : it can be modified
	Immutable : it can't be modified
note:All the Strings are Immutable in Java Script



Common Opertaions...length ,slice(start idx, end-1 idx),
indexOf(searchElement, fromIndex),
note:Sort() this can't be done in string


			2.String Terminology

Substring:in this it starts from the starting index and ends at the last before index takes all the char of the string
let str = "Hello World";
str.slice(2,7);
console.log(str);
//output = "llo w"

Subsequence:based on us like...(h l o w r d)we can pic any char but in a sequence way


			3.Prefix && Suffix
Prefix:Starting index is a prefix
"Hello"
Prefix = H
Prefix = He
Prefix = Hel
Prefix = Hell
Prefix = Hello

Suffix:Strting from the last index 
Hello
Suffix=o
Suffix=ol
Suffix=oll
Suffix=olle
Suffix=olleH


note :By default Java Script Reads Numbers also as a string 


				Problems
		1.Capitalize

Note :ASCII Values (imp to remember)

		UpperCase: Starts From A=65
		LowerCase: Starts From a=97
		numbers : Starts from 0=48

note: Convert LowerCase to UpperCase (just need to subtract 32)
		97-32 = 65
		a - 32 = A

to convert : 3 Steps are needed 
	1.get the ascii value
	2.do the subtraction
	3.convert it ascii back to char


note:charCodeAt(index) it returns the ASCII values of the lowerCase string
note:String.fromCharCode(num1, num2, /* â€¦, */ numN) convets from ascii values to the String


			4.Binary Search
note:pre-requisite: input Should be sorted 
two pointers are used left index[] and the right index[]   l+r/2   || mid+1
time complexity O(logn)
