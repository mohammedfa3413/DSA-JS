1.Debugging:Fixing Errors 
	Types OF errors 
	      compile time error 
	      runtime error 
	      Logical Error 


	

compile time error 
	Syntax error


runtime error 
	Calling a function which doesn't Exist	

Logical Error 
	Not getting a proper output 


2.Map DS
	it stores 2 things key and value (note:value is dependent on keys) (note :Key should be unique)
	key and value can be anything(str,num,bool,undefined.....etc)

	CRUD Operations on map (note: All the operations in crud have timecomplexity is O(1))
		CREAT 
		READ
		UPDATE/INSERT
		DELETE


	methods 
		set(key,value) creat or insert / update
		get(key) read 
		has(key) checks weather key is present in map or not 
		delete(key) it will delete a key and value 
		clear() it resets the map 

***imp****   when we have to use map data structure
		[occurences,frequency,count];

	implementing a map [const variableName = new Map();]
note:two extra loops are there in java script 
	for of loop  -- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of#examples
	for in loop

	1.MostFrequency


3.Set Data Structure : it says how many unique and distinct elements are there
(it only stores a key)(key has to be unique)
note:if the repeated key is occured it just ignores

***imp****   when we have to use set data structure
			[unique,distinct,duplicate]

		methods
			add(value)
			has(value)
			delete(value)
			clear(value)
