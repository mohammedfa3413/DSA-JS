note: When ever we have to go through all the elements in a string or array problems big O(n) can be used


	Space Complexity(ram)
primitive data type takes 1unit of space


note:in js array have same data type 

note : it has 4 variations 
	1.O(1)  primitive data type
	2.O(N)	arrays and strings
	3.O(N^2)
	4.Hidden space Complexity in recurssion 


1.Arrays (1D)

	note :Always stick to index[0] to index[n-1]    basic:splic(),slice(),push(),pop(),shift(),unshift(), reverse() ,   sort()
	Basic Operation of Array
	1.Rotation
	2.Reverse
	3.Sorting

note: sort():Sortes in Lexicographical order which is dict way


		Solved One Problem In vs Code 
		1.Find Elements


2.Matrix (2 Dimentional)
		square:all rows and columns are equale
		rectangular:all rows and columns are not equale


Traversal in matrix
	row by row 
	column by column
	primary diagnol 
	secondary diagnol


	problem on matrix (2D Array)
	1.Magic Square
