				DSA JS Notes 

				 Session-1



Revision 



1.Variable:(assigning the values or initializing)
	eg: a=10,b=20;



2.Data Type:(what kind of data to be stored)
	
	eg:boolean,number,undefined,null,object,string,symbol

	string:it is not a primitive data type..it containes a char 



	primitive data type (boolean,number,undefined,null)
		number:it stores all kinds of numbers (int,double,decimal....)
		boolean: stores true or false 
		undefined:unintentionally displayes if the vales are not defined 
		null:it is done intentionally 


3.Diff B/W data type and data structure 

	data type:what ur going to store
	data structure:how ur going to store 

	

4.Constrains
	it says the range for the input 
	eg:1<=10,b<=20




5.Debugging
	solving errors



6.Conditionals:
		if(){
		}else{
		}


	nested elseif ladder:(More complex conditions are given then this is better to use)
		if(){
		}elseif{
		}


	Swithch Cse:(if the conditions are not complicated then this contional statement can be used)
		switch(){
		case1:	
			break;
		case2:
			break;
		.
		.
		.
		default:Invalid
		{


//Problems are solved in Vs Code based on normal js practice
	1.FindQadrant(2d plane graph)



7.Loops
	1.for loop
	for(initialization;condition;incrementation/decrementation){}

	2.while loop (it is know as entry controlled loop)
	syantax:
		first initialization (eg:let = 0;)
		while(){
		   Print
		   incrementation||decrementation
		}

	3.do while loop (it is an exit controlled loop) note:this runs a code atleast one time 
	syntax:
		do{
		   print 
		   incrementation||decrementation
		  }while(); 


8.Continue && Break Statement
	
	 Break:it helps to come out of the loop
	continue:it helps to skip the current itteration

1.Time Complexity  && Space Complexity

		Time Complexity:(no of times a statement is exicuted with respect to input)
			checks exicution time 
			depends on hardware 
			
	

	Take Home Assignments Done In Vs Code 

	1.N natural numbers (Done)
	2.leap year	(Done)
